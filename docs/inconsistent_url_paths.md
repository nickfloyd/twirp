The [official Go implementation](https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp) differs in behavior from what is described in the [specification](https://twitchtv.github.io/twirp/docs/spec_v5.html). It modifies the service and method names to be CamelCase (with an initial capital) instead of using the exact names specified in the protobuf definition. This means that the URL paths generated for Go clients and servers may differ from paths generated for other language implementations. This issue is discussed in [#244](https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp/issues/244).

In order to ensure compatibility across languages, it is recommended to follow the [Protocol Buffers Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style#services) for method and service names by CamelCasing them. This ensures that the URL paths generated by Twirp are consistent across language implementations.
